#Firstly I initialized the min and max variables 
#with first element of the given list
#
#While itearting the list I updated the min and max variables
#
#So this algorithm finds the min and max elements in one iteration
#runtime complexity is O(n)
#
#Also this algorithm takes up n elements in memory
#so space complexity of this algorithm is O(n)
