#firstly I took the given list 
#and sorted with mergesort algorithm which time complexity is O(nlogn)
#and I began to put together numbers from bigger to smaller
#while one step skipping to backwards in one iteration O(n)

#so time complexity is --> O(n)


#space complexity of merge sort is O(n) and rearrange_digits(input_list)
#function space complexity is O(n),

#so space complexity is --> O(n)
