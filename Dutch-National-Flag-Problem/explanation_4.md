# Explanation & time and space complexity analysis

## Explanation
I decided to to keep information about next 0 and next 2 position, to move next element
to correct place. It ensure, that there will be only one iteration through list.

## Time complexity
Time complexity is O(n) because in worst case we need to check every element to put all
of them in correct positions.

## Space complexity
Space complexity is O(n), input data with n element is kept.
